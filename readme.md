[Website and documentation](https://kvaesitso.mm20.de)

## Installation

### Using an F-Droid client and MM20's repository

The preferred way of installation is using the [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org) application. That way
you will always be notified about updates. Kvaesitso is available in the official F-Droid
repository, but all features depending on non-foss external APIs were removed.
For feature-complete builds you can add [MM20's repository](https://fdroid.mm20.de). Just scan the code below or open
the link on your phone:

The same version is also available in [IzzyOnDroid's repository](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/de.mm20.launcher2.release).

### Manual installation

You can also download the latest release from
the [releases page](https://github.com/MM2-0/Kvaesitso/releases/latest) and install it manually.
