<p><i>Kvaesitso</i> is a launcher application for Android which replaces the device's default home screen. It has been built from scratch, meaning it is not based on the AOSP launcher (like many other third party launchers) nor does it try to recreate this launcher. Instead, <i>Kvæsitso</i> follows its own concepts.</i><p>The main feature is a global search which does not only let you search on device for apps, contacts, and calendar events, but also on web services like Wikipedia or your Nextcloud Instance. Additionally it includes some useful tools, for example a calculator and a unit converter. You are looking for a document or an information? Just search for it and <i>Kvæsitso</i> shows you the fastest way to it.</p>
