# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I get app icons on the home screen?

There are two options:

1. Go to Settings > Home screen > Clock and enable "Favorites". This will display the first row of pinned items
   as part of the clock widget.

2. Scroll down to the end of the widgets list, select "Edit widgets" > "Add widget" > "Favorites" to add
   the favorites widget to the home screen.

## Can I remove / customize the clock?

Yes, you can customize the clock style by going to Settings > Home screen > Clock and selecting a different
style. There is also an "empty style" that will remove the clock entirely.

## The toggle to grant notification access is disabled
