# Per-Item Customization

Apps and other search results can be customized individually. Long-press an item and select Customize (or the <span class="material-symbols-rounded">edit</span> icon) in the menu.

## Custom labels

Change the label of an item. Both the custom label and the original label are used in search.

## Custom icons

Change the icon of an item. There are a number of different options:

- use the default icon according to launcher preferences
- use the original icon: bypass any launcher preferences and use the unmodified original app icon
- for legacy (non-adaptive) icons: several options to transform legacy icons into adaptive icons
- all icons from installed icons pack for that app
- a [themed icon](themed-icons) (either from the app itself, or from a themed icon provider package, or an autogenerated one)
- a placeholder icon

You can also use the search field to search for icons in installed icon packs.

## Tags

Assign and remove [tags](../concepts/tags).
