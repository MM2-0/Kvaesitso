# Get Started

Kvaesitso is available for Android devices running Android 8.0 or higher.

## Installation

The latest APK can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/MM2-0/Kvaesitso/releases).

To make sure that you get always notified about the latest updates, it's recommended that you add my F-Droid repo:
https://fdroid.mm20.de

You can also download it from the [IzzyOnDroid](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/de.mm20.launcher2.release) F-Droid repo but keep in mind that updates are usually delayed for a day when using that repo.

If you want to verify the app's signature before installing, here are the signing key fingerprints:
