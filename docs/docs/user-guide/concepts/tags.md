# Tags

Tags are a way to organize apps and other items.

- Tags are used as keywords in the search; you can use tags to assign additional keywords.
- Tags can be added to the [favorites](favorites) section, this allows faster access to all items that have that tag assigned.

## Create and assign tags

There are three ways to create tags and assign them to items:

1. Long-press any search result and select “Customize” (or the <span class="material-symbols-rounded">edit</span> icon) in the menu.
2. Type a comma-separated list of tags into the tags input field.

OR

1. Open the [edit favorites sheet](/docs/user-guide/concepts/favorites#customization).
