# Weather Widget

A widget that displays current and future weather data.

## Configuration

The weather widget can be configured by tapping "Edit widgets" and then selecting the <span class="material-symbols-rounded">tune</span> icon
on the weather widget.

- **Compact mode**: If enabled, the widget will only display the current weather data. Forecast data will be hidden.
- **Weather integration settings**: A shortcut to [Settings > Integrations > Weather](/docs/user-guide/integrations/weather). This is where you can configure
  which weather provider to use and which location to get weather data for.
