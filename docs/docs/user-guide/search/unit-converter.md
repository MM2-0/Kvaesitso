# Unit Converter

The unit converter is a tool to convert units.

## Usage

Type number followed by a space and a unit symbol into the search bar.
Examples:

- `1 m`
- `3600 s`
- `12.5 kg`

You can also specify a target unit like this:

- `14 ft >> m`
- `14 ft > m`
- `14 ft - m`

If you don't specify a target unit, all supported units in the dimension of the input unit are returned.

### Unit symbols

Unit symbols can differ between different languages, therefore an exhaustive list wouldn't be very useful here. You can find the unit symbol for each unit in parentheses in the unit converter result list.

Units of the following dimensions are supported:

- Units of time: `ms`, `s`, `min`, `h`, …
- Units of length: `m`, `km`, `in`, `ft`, …
- Units of mass: `kg`, `t`, `oz.`, …
- Units of area: `m²`, `ha`, `sqyd`, …
- Units of data: `bit`, `B`, `kB`, `MiB`, …
- Units of speed: `km/h`, `mph`, `m/s`, …
- Units of temperature: `°C`, `°F`, `K`
- Currencies (if currency converter is enabled in unit converter settings): `EUR`, `USD`, `GBP`, …
