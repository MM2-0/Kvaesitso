# Filters

Filters are used to narrow down the search results.

## Apply filters

There are two ways to apply filters:

1. Tap the <span class="material-symbols-rounded">filter_alt</span> icon in the search bar to open
   the filter menu.
2. Use the filter bar that is displayed above the keyboard when it is open.

Filters are reset when the search bar is cleared.

## Available filters

- **Online results:** Allows the launcher to search online services like Wikipedia. This filter is
  disabled by default, to protect your privacy.
- **Type filters:**: Filter by result type (e.g., apps, contacts, files, places â€¦). Neither of these
  filters imply an online search. You need to enable the online results filter as well if
  you want to search Wikipedia, for example.
- **Hidden results**: Show search results that were hidden by the user.

## Customization

You can customize which filters are pre-selected by default in Settings > Search > Default filter.

You can customize the items and order of the filters in the filter bar in Settings > Search >
Customize filter bar.
