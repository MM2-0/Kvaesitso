# Online Results

Kvaesitso integrates with several online services, for example Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap.
Additional online services can be integrated via plugins.

In order to protect your privacy and to avoid unnecessary network traffic, online results are
disabled by default.

To enable online results, you need to enable the "Online results" filter.
You can customize the default filter to always include online results, but keep in mind that this
may have an impact on your privacy, since *all* search queries are sent to external services then.
See [Filters](filters) for more information.
