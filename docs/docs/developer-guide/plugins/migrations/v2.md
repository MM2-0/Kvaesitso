# Migrate from v1.x to v2.x

Version 2.0.0 of the plugin SDK introduces some breaking changes:

## Name changes

- The `SearchPluginConfig` class has been renamed to `QueryPluginConfig`

## Signature changes

### `FileProvider`

### `search`

```kt
suspend fun search(query: String, allowNetwork: Boolean): List<File>
```

has been changed to

 - `lang` - the language to use for the search

### `get`

```kt
suspend fun get(id: String): File?
```

has been changed to

```kt
suspend fun get(id: String, params: GetParams): File?
```
