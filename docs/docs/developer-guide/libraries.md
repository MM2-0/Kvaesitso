# Libraries

The following libraries are commonly used (libraries that are only used in single modules are not listed here as they are implementation details):

- **AndroidX Room** to store launcher data in an Sqlite database
- **AndroidX Protobuf Datastore** to store additional user preferences
- **Koin** for dependency injection
- **Coil** to load and transform images
- **OkHttp and Retrofit** for HTTP requests
- Several other **AndroidX** libraries (Work, Lifecycle, AppCompat, …)
