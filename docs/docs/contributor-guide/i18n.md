# Translations and I18n

Kvaesitso supports a number of different languages. You can contribute translations in your language
using the [project's Weblate instance](https://i18n.mm20.de/engage/kvaesitso/).

Sign up with your Github account and start translating. If your language does not exist yet, you can
create it.

There are two main components in the `Launcher` category, `i18n` and `units`:

- `i18n` is the main component that contains most of the strings that are used within the app.

- `units` is an extra component that contains all the strings that are used by the unit converter.
  Each unit has a `unit_[name]` and a `unit_[name]_symbol` resource. `unit_[name]_symbol` is the
  symbol that is used in the search query. For SI units, this should typically be the SI symbol (m,
  s, kg and so on), but other, non-SI units may need their symbols to be translated (for example,
  nautical miles or horse powers).

- `unit_[name]` is the full name of the unit that is used in the unit converter results. It's a
  plural resource, for different quantities of that unit.

There are also some other components that are related to plugin apps, but they are less important,
as they are not part of the main app.

## Icons and other resources

There are currently no icons that would require localization but in case there were you could simply
create a new pull request including the localized resources.

`defaults.xml` contains (non-string) factory settings for different regions. At the moment this is
only used to enable imperial units for US users.
