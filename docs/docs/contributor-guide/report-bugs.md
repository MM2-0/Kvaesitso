# Report Bugs

The easiest way to get involved is to report bugs on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/MM2-0/Kvaesitso/issues). Before you open a new issue, please make sure you have searched for existing issues to avoid duplications and that you are running the latest release version of the launcher.

Please include all relevant information such as:

- The **device** you are using
- The **Android version**
- **Steps to reproduce**
- Relevant settings if they seem to be relevant to the issue

## Crash reports

When the launcher crashes, a crash report is automatically generated. You can find these crash reports at Settings > Debug > Crash Reporter.

Use the <span class="material-symbols-rounded">bug_report</span> icon in the top right corner to open an new issue with that report. Make sure to fill in additional information before submitting, such as steps to reproduce (if possible) or what you were trying to do when the launcher crashed.

## Logs

Logs can be exported at Settings > Debug > Export logs. Most of the time it is not necessary to submit logs unless your asked to do so.
